# Project Name: Space Adventure 3398
=======
> Space Adventure 3398 is an arcade style game is developed by Tanner Coker, Lucas Anesti, Brice Asburn, Erik Cortez, and Eric Figueroa.
> It will feature a main menu with options to: start the game, view the scoreboard, go to settings, and to exit the game. 
> The game will have a space theme and it will be like a retro arcade game. The gameplay will consist of the player having basic 
> movements and having to shoot projectiles at the enemies in order to wipe them out. The player will be able to progress through 
> stages and will encounter boss fights and more difficult enemies along their travels. The game will save the top scores of 
> all players across multiple play sessions which is viewable in the scoreboard. Players can also find some settings and will be 
> able to tweak some gameplay settings through a settings area which is on the main menu.
> We're making this game so that we can further develop our skills as programmers but make it entertaining for anybody to enjoy.
> The game would be for an audience of many or people who just want to play a fun arcade style game.
